# rock-paper-scissors

A very simple rock-paper-scissors python console game. 

I did this game because I forgot how to use github and I needed practice.

Execute this program with "python3 rps.py" in the archive's location.

You will play against the computer any times you want. 

To exit the game type 'e', 'ex' or 'exit'.

To stop the program, you can press ctrl+c.
