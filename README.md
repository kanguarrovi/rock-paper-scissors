# rock-paper-scissors

A very simple rock-paper-scissors python console game. 

I did this game because I forgot how to use github and I needed practice.

Execute this program with "python3 rps.py" in the archive's location.

You will play against the computer any time you want. 

To stop the program, press ctrl+c.
